AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) provides you the ability to securely share your resources across AWS accounts or within your Organization. You can now centrally procure resources and use RAM to share resources with other accounts, eliminating the need to provision and manage resources in every account. When you share a resource with another account, that account is granted access to the resource and any policies and permissions in that account will apply to the shared resource.
