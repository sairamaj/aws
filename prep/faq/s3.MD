Retrieve an entire object—A single GET operation can return you the entire object stored in Amazon S3.

Retrieve object in parts—Using the Range HTTP header in a GET request, you can retrieve a specific range of bytes in an object stored in Amazon S3.

You resume fetching other parts of the object whenever your application is ready. This resumable download is useful when you need only portions of your object data. It is also useful where network connectivity is poor and you need to react to failures.

With Amazon S3 Select, you can use simple structured query language (SQL) statements to filter the contents of Amazon S3 objects and retrieve just the subset of data that you need. By using Amazon S3 Select to filter this data, you can reduce the amount of data that Amazon S3 transfers, which reduces the cost and latency to retrieve this data

Amazon S3 Select works on objects stored in CSV, JSON, or Apache Parquet format. It also works with objects that are compressed with GZIP or BZIP2 (for CSV and JSON objects only), and server-side encrypted objects. You can specify the format of the results as either CSV or JSON, and you can determine how the records in the result are delimited.

With version enabled S3 objects, each version can have different retention periods.`
