Retrieve an entire object—A single GET operation can return you the entire object stored in Amazon S3.

Retrieve object in parts—Using the Range HTTP header in a GET request, you can retrieve a specific range of bytes in an object stored in Amazon S3.

You resume fetching other parts of the object whenever your application is ready. This resumable download is useful when you need only portions of your object data. It is also useful where network connectivity is poor and you need to react to failures.
