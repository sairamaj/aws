[usage patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/usage-patterns.html)
* Use for
    * web content
    * streaming
    * backup/storage
    * computational data
* Not for
    * queries(DynamoDB,RDS)
    * file system(EFS)
    * Frequent updates
[Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/performance.html)
* Between EC2 and S3 in the same region is fast
* Multi part upload (parallels)
* Use DynamoDB,RDS to query and the S3 for actual information
* S3 transfer acceleration for fast,easy,secure over long distances
    * Need to enable on s3 bucket
    * endpoint is different
[Durability and Availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/durability-and-availability.html)
* 11 9s on object durability
* 4  9s on availability
* can enable cross-region replication per object
[Scalability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/scalability-and-elasticity.html)
* unlimited number of objects in bucket
[Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/security.html)
* server side / client side encryption
* multi factor authentcation on version and deletions.
[Cost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/cost-model.html)
* storage (per GB per month)
* data transfer in and our (per GB  per month)
* requests(per thousand requests per month)

[Concurrent applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html)

```cmd
---W1----(x)
             ---W2----(y)
                   --R1(x/y)		R2(y)
---W1----(x)

   ---W2-----(y)
                    ---R(x/y)
best way to determine the final value is to perform a read after both writes have been acknowledged.
```
